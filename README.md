# USACO2023-December-Bronze

The USA Computing Olympiad is a competition occuring four times a year that tests participants on coding algorithms, similar to the CCC. There are four levels of difficulty: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.

The files in this repository are the pieces of code I used to complete the bronze ranked competition in December 2023. The competition helps with understanding scenarios where different algorithms may be used. The code for questions one passed twelve of fourteen cases, the code for question two passed with full marks, and the code for question three passed twelve out of thirteen marks.
